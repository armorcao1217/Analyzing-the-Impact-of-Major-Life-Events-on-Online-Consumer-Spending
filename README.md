# The Impact of Major Life Events on Online Consumer Spending

This project investigates whether events such as job loss, divorce, moving, pregnancy, or having a child lead to measurable changes in online spending patterns. The analysis combines survey-reported life events with transaction-level purchase data to understand behavioral shifts over time.

## Research Questions  
In this project, we want to investigate whether specific individual life events—such as Job Loss, Divorce, and Moving—drive similar shifts towards online platforms like Amazon.

Sub-1: Do disruptive life events increase online spending?

Sub-2: Are behavioral changes temporary or persistent?

Sub-3: What policy implications emerge from consumer response patterns?

## Dataset  
This project analyzes e-commerce consumer behavior using data from the "Open e-commerce 1.0" dataset (Berke et al., 2023), sourced from the Harvard Dataverse. The dataset contains respondent' demographic information and Amazon spending behavior. Each observation represents an individual survey respondent with associated spending data. We merged survey and transaction datasets and constructed a total spending metric to analyze behavioral change.

## Key Findings

### 1️⃣ Job Loss Increases Online Spending
- ~12% increase in Amazon spending during the year of job loss  
- Suggests substitution toward lower-cost online goods  
👉 **Interpretation:** Economic shocks may shift consumers toward price-sensitive online purchasing behavior.

### 2️⃣ Divorce Shows Moderate Effects
- ~23% spending increase (marginal significance)  

**Possible drivers:**
- Household reconfiguration  
- Emotional coping behavior  
👉 **Interpretation:** Behavioral responses to life transitions may temporarily increase discretionary spending.

### 3️⃣ Other Events Show Limited Impact
- Moving, pregnancy, and having a child were not statistically significant.

## Policy Implications
- Provide targeted subsidies or vouchers for individuals experiencing job loss  
- Expand access to low-cost counseling and financial support programs  

<br>

## Limitations
- Life events recorded only in 2021 → timing approximated across years  
- Measurement error may attenuate true effect sizes  
- Macro shocks explain a large share of variation in spending
